# tellme
### (current build wont work, upgrading it all to python during this week)

Simple little script (for now) that will send you a Telegram message when you add it as a pipe in a command.

## Dependencies:
- python3
- pyTelegramBotAPI
- Small amount of knowledge of how your bash history works (I use fish, so if its telling you the wrong commands finish then that would be why :D)

## Setup:
- create a .env with:
-- API_KEY=(your Telegram bots API key)
-- USER_KEY=(your Telegram ID)
